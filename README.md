# 🌾 Harvest Helper: Smart Agriculture with Blockchain & Machine Learning

Harvest Helper is a decentralized web-based platform that revolutionizes agricultural supply chain management by integrating **blockchain**, **smart contracts**, and **machine learning** to enhance **transparency, traceability, and productivity** in farming.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 **Blockchain-Powered Supply Chain**  
  All crop-related actions—applications, verifications, grading, and pricing—are immutably recorded on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.

- 🤖 **AI-Driven Crop & Fertilizer Prediction**  
  Utilizes machine learning to recommend optimal crops and fertilizers based on real-time soil and environmental parameters.

- 📋 **Smart Contract Automation**  
  Automates mid-term crop assessments, harvest scheduling, and pricing mechanisms with Ethereum-based contracts.

- 📦 **Integrated eCommerce Module**  
  Farmers list verified crops; dealers can securely purchase with transparent history and quality data.

- 👨‍🌾 **Role-Based System Access**  
  - **Farmers**: Apply for crop sale, track status, receive recommendations  
  - **Review Team**: Verify crop quality at multiple stages  
  - **Admins**: Oversee operations, manage listings  
  - **Dealers**: Browse and buy crops via marketplace

- 🧠 **Real-Time Tracking & Notifications**  
  Users receive email/SMS updates at every major step in the crop lifecycle.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python), Web3.py
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (via Ganache), Solidity Smart Contracts
- **ML Models**: Crop & Fertilizer Prediction (Trained on environmental datasets)
